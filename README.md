# Anthropomorphic Robot Hand and Arm CAD Model

![](https://github.com/hansonrobotics/Anthropomorphic-Robot-Hand/blob/master/imgs/Arms_Solid_LR.png)

## Description

* CAD model (SolidWorks 2017) of a pair of anthropomorphic robotics arms. Arms and hands have size and proportions of adult human upper limbs. Hands are capable of holding objects weighing up to 500 grams.

* Each arm has the following 7 DoF: Shoulder pitch, Shoulder roll, Shoulder yaw, Shoulder shrug, Elbow pitch, Wrist roll, Wrist pitch.

* Each hand has the following 9 DoF: independent thumb, index, and middle flexion/extension, full flexion to full extension in 1 sec, independent thumb abduction/adduction, full abduction to full adduction in 1 sec, underactuated fingers.

* Arm shape is suitable to support clothing.

* Shoulder pitch range of motion will be limited mechanically to 180 deg to prevent electrical cable damage (stopper).
