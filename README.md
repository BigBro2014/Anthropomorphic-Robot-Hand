Anthropomorphic Robot Hand and Arm CAD Model

CAD model (SolidWorks 2017) of a pair of anthropomorphic robotics arms. Arms and hands have size and proportions of adult human upper limbs. Hands are be capable of holding objects weighing up to 500 grams.

Each arm has the following 7 DoF: Shoulder pitch, Shoulder roll, Shoulder yaw, Shoulder shrug, Elbow pitch, Wrist roll, Wrist pitch.

Each hand has the following 9 DoF: independent thumb, index, and middle flexion/extension, full flexion to full extension in 1 sec, independent thumb abduction/adduction, full abduction to full adduction in 1 sec, underactuated fingers.

Arms shape are suitable to support clothing.

Shoulder pitch range of motion will be limited mechanically to 180 deg to prevent electrical cable damage (stopper).
